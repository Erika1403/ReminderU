1. Project Setup and Library Installation:

Create a React Native project: If you don't have one already, use npx react-native init MyAlarmApp to create a new project.
Install text-to-speech library: We'll use react-native-tts for both Android and iOS. Run npm install react-native-tts --save to install it.
Link the library (Android only): For Android, link the library using react-native link react-native-tts.
2. Scheduling Functionality:

Import necessary libraries: In your component file, import react-native-tts and libraries for scheduling, such as react-native-schedule or the built-in AsyncStorage.
3. Alarm Setup Component:

Create state variables: Define state variables to hold alarm details like time, message, and isAlarmActive.
Timepicker: Implement a time picker component using libraries like react-native-datetimepicker or a custom solution. Allow users to select the desired alarm time.
Text input: Create a text input field where users can enter the message to be spoken at the alarm time.
Toggle switch: Add a toggle switch to activate/deactivate the alarm.
4. Alarm Scheduling and Text-to-Speech:

Schedule the alarm:
Upon setting the alarm time, use react-native-schedule or AsyncStorage to store the alarm details with a scheduled trigger at the selected time.
Consider using a background job library like react-native-background-fetch (Android) or react-native-background-task (iOS) to ensure the alarm functionality works even when the app is in the background.
5. Background Task/Notification (Optional):

Background job: If using background jobs, create a background task that will trigger when the scheduled time arrives.
Notification (iOS): On iOS, consider using react-native-push-notification to send a local notification at the scheduled time, which will wake up the app and trigger the alarm functionality.
6. Alarm Trigger and Text-to-Speech Execution:

In the scheduled task/triggered notification handler:
Fetch the alarm details from storage.
Use react-native-tts.speak(message) to speak the alarm message. You can customize speech options like language and pitch.
Optionally, you can play an alarm sound using react-native-sound in conjunction with text-to-speech.
7. User Interaction and Cancelling Alarms:

Snooze/Dismiss buttons: If desired, implement buttons to snooze or dismiss the alarm when it triggers.
Alarm list/management: Allow users to view and manage a list of created alarms with options to edit or delete them.
